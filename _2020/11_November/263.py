"""
Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and
determines whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the
program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

    The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase
    letter or a space.
    All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (,,;,:) or
    terminal marks (.,?,!,â€½).
    There must be a single space between each word.
    The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.
